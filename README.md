myportals
=========

craftbukkit teleportation plugin

i think maybe you can download entire project as zip and import directly into eclipse as an existing project, correct me if i am wrong

i am not a java/eclipse/github expert.. as many concepts are new to me, i fear someday i push the wrong button and mess all the files .. if you understand these things please tell me to ask you some things when in doubt and help me, thanks

project page or MyPortals are here -> http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/myportals/ ... there you can read more info and post any message you want, and subscribe to stay informed

i intended this plugin with gplv3 license .. i like free software (as in freedom) and its philosophy, i wished make this plugin colaborative, i learned a lot by making this plugin and want everybody learns and make this plugin grow
