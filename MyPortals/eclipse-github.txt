    In eclipse, open the view 'Git Repositories'.

    Ensure you see your local repository and can see the remote repository as a subfolder. In my version, it's called Remotes, and then I can see the remote project within that.

    Look for the green arrow pointing to the left, this is the 'fetch' arrow. Right click and select 'Configure Fetch'.

    You should see the URI, ensure that it points to the remote repository.

    Look in the ref mappings section of the pop-up. Mine was empty. This will indicate which remote references you want to fetch. Click 'Add'.

    Type in the branch name you need to fetch from the remote repository. Mine was 'Master' (btw, a dropdown here would be great!!, for now, you have to type it). Continue through the pop-up, eventually clicking 'Finish'.

    Click 'Save and Fetch'. This will fetch that remote reference.

    Look in the 'Branches' folder of your local repository. You should now see that remote branch in the remote folder. Again, I see 'master'.

    Right-Click on the local branch in the 'Local' folder of 'Branches'. Select 'Merge', and then select the remote branch.

    Process through the merge.

    Commit any changes to your local repository.

    Push your changes to the remote repository.

    Go have a tasty beverage, congratulating yourself. Take the rest of the day off.

- github account with your pc ssh key added

- yourNewRepo - clone url - ssh - COPY URL

in eclipse - git repos view

- yourNewRepo - expand - remotes - rclick - PASTE URI - next - (delete dir before *) - finish
- (* (commit before) click browse - move repo dir to another location (backup) - click back + click next)

in eclipse - pkg explorer

- myProj - rclick - team - share - git
- repo: select created repo - finish
- config your libs and do your push

- pkg expl - myProj - delete all sources first
- pkg expl - myProj - rclick - replace with - commit - select one
- (edit sources and) push

WORK WITH BRANCHES
