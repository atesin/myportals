portal: |
  Teleport anywhere by building custom portals.
  Ask your server the current portal shape and activation.
   
  - Select a portal by looking its base with your crosshair.
  - Then you must set a name, and optionally a destination.
  - Enter the portal to teleport to destination, exit to cancel.
   
  Can also set privacy, give to someone, or list portals.
  If breaks will deactivate, recreate in same place to keep links.

  - lock = can't modify with any command.
  - hide = won't be shown with "list" command.
  - private = won't bring you teleported, ok for private places.
helplist: |
  "/portal list [somePlayer|*] [pageNumber]" = list portals
   
  - If "somePlayer" is ommited is replaced by your name (*=all).
  - If "pageNumber" is ommited is replaced by "1".
