portal: |
  Teleport anywhere by building nether like custom portals.
  Ask your server the current portal shape and activation.
   
  - Select a portal by looking its base with your crosshair.
  - You must set a name, and optionally a destination.
  - Enter the portal to teleport to destination, exit to cancel.
   
  Can also set privacy, give to someone, or list portals.
  If breaks will deactivate, recreate in same place to keep links.
  To list available portal commands type "/portal help".

  - Essential = name, dest
  - Privacy = public, lock, hide, private
  - Ownership = give
  - Informational = list, info
helpName: |
  "/portal name myPortal" = gives the portal a [new] name
   
  - When create a portal give it a name immediately.
  - Most commands requires the portal have a name.
  - Naming a fresh activated portal gives you the ownership.

  - lock = can't modify with any command.
  - hide = won't be shown with "list" command.
  - private = won't bring you teleported, ok for private places.

  - Portal must be public.
  - Reciever player must be online.
helpList: |
  "/portal list [somePlayer|*] [pageNumber]" = list portals
   
  - If "somePlayer" is omitted will assume yours (*=all).
  - If "pageNumber" is omitted will assume page 1.
